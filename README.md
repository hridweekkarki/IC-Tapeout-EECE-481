# IC-Tapeout-EECE-481
Designed RTL, tested logical verification, collected coverage, synthesized, and optimized place & route for an integrated circuit using TSMC 180 nm node library and Cadence EDA Tools. Along with IO ring design and abutment, DRC and LVS checks were executed before GDS file generation. Completed and verified designs were sent for fabrication.
